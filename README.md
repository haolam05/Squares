# Squares

  - An application that allows users to create and delete files, enabling the continuous subdivision of squares into smaller parts, and color customization for each square.
  - Users can navigate through the interface to split squares recursively, assigning various colors to distinct components. Additionally, the application supports merging squares back to their original form and provides functionality to save the created patterns.
  - Leveraging TypeScript's features, including inductive types and recursion, the project ensures efficient code organization. TypeScript's type annotations and compiler are utilized to maintain code clarity and identify errors promptly during development, ensuring a robust and manageable codebase.
